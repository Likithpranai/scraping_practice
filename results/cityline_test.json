Though he and his family run the place with hope and optimism, their little inn struggles to attract guests.  Just when they think they have turned a corner with their first guest, their real nightmare has only just begun.\n\nBarely a month after presenting the shockingly violent Ichi the Killer (2001) at Toronto International Film Festival, director Takashi Miike debuted The Happiness of the Katakuris—a horror comedy— at Tokyo International Film Festival. A delirious concoction that includes claymation, song and dance, and karaoke, The Happiness of the Katakuris is as zany as films come. Best known for his gory pictures, the prolific Japanese director showcases a wide range of creative prowess in this hilarious gem.\n\nThis film will be presented in a rare 35mm print.\n\nNotice to Ticket-Purchasers\n\n1.
