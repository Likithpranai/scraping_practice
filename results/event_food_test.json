The creation of Organic Hill was personal, it was health conscious, it was me.Leon's Organic wine journey began personally back in 2009 when he realised that he was Gluten intolerant (not Coeliac) and needed to find Gluten free products. This led him to discover the myriad of Organic shops located in and around Melbourne, many of which also sold Organic wine.  After lots of trial and error searching for a solution to my intolerances, it became obvious that it was also Preservatives that I was allergic to, therefore Organic simply made sense.=====📅 31/07/2025 (Thursday)🕗 19:30🏠 The Victuals3/F, Bayfield Building, 99 Hennessy Road, Wan Chai💰 $980 (4 Courses Menu)🍽️Sous Vide Watermelon with Tiger Prawns🍽️Pan Seared Matsusaka Pork Toro🍽️Dry Aged Beef Cannelloni🍽️Grilled Greekstone Prime Ribeye🍷Paired with 6 glasses of Australian Organic Wine and a cult red wine worth $1380 per bottle=====Little Bit More About Organic Hill Wines~Organic Hill Winemaker - Matt Wenk⭐Former chief winemaker for Two Hands Wines (2002 - 2013)⭐A fact that is largely unknown Matt remains the only winemaker in the world to have wines of his making in internationally acclaimed Wine Spectator top 100 for 10 consecutive years."
