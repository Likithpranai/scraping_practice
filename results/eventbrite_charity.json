    "about": "Hey, Hong Kong!When was the last time you did something completely spontaneous? Our series groups together complete strangers for a fun day out. That's right, you sign up, and we book the restaurant. We know life can get busy. Don't forget to spend time making new friends! Don't do city life alone and build your community with us. This project is to host dinners in 100 major cities to combat loneliness while supporting locally owned businesses. We are dedicating 25% of sales towards charity or GoFundMe pages at the end of each month.How does it work?-After you register, you'll be emailed an introduction message including a quick questionnaire regarding age, dietary restrictions, hobbies, and interests that we use to select restaurants for the night's group.-At the end of the month, we'll share sales reports with attendees and detail how we are utilizing 25% of sales towards social good.*Your registration does not include your individual food and drink purchases.*These outings are intended to help people make friends. These are not singles gatherings.Our vision is simple: we take the no gimmicks approach to networking. No need for yet another app to take up space on your phone - just four walls and a roof and good food for people to connect :) We coordinate with you directly, human-to-human.If you have any more questions, please contact ermantourageimpact@gmail.com!Brought to you by event series Ermantourage.You can also take a look at our main event calendar via Posh for coffee meets, evening hangouts, and more!"
