No speech. Just intentional conversations.Come join us on Aug 10 (Sun) for an afternoon to meet other fellow women changemakers and explore your creativity via soundhealing and writing!What is Women Changemakers Community Series?The idea began in the summer of 2023 when two changemakers in Hong Kong, Carmen (Girls Be Change) and Dorothy (Dream Impact), questioned and envisioned what an ideal community is. We need a safe place among women changemakers to have organic meetups, intentional conversations and idea exchange with social ease, find inspirations and encouragement from each other, and build authentic friendships and support networks.The first Women Changemakers Community Gathering was held in Hong Kong on March 8, 2024 at International Women’s Day. Ever since then, Girls Be Change cohosted with 20 (and counting) organizations and gathered over 150 (and counting) women changemakers in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Kenya, and Tanzania. With 15+ gatherings around the globe, a vibrant community of global women changemakers was formed and connected virtually to raise questions, exchange ideas, and celebrate wins.​Co-organizers:"

Elio will share his experience in the project and how Lisca Bianca affects the lives of the participants.A Q&A session with both Elio and Giuseppe on the project, will be conducted after the sharing. Participants will come together afterwards for a convivial gathering.“It’s a story I would describe as magical, in the young people who participate in our programs, I see a deep transformation: they begin to believe in themselves again. They learn that achieving a dream takes courage, hard work, sacrifice, and passion—things they often thought they had lost.”Elio Lo Cascio, president of the Lisca Bianca Association.Lisca Bianca is a 12-meter schooner that once set sail with the aim to travel around the world. In 2013, Lisca Bianca was found abandoned in a shipyard in Palermo, days away from demolition. That’s when sociologist and sailing enthusiast Elio Lo Cascio, along with naval architect Francesco Belvisi, stepped in. Moved by the story told in the travel diary written by Sergio Albeggiani, the previous owner of Lisca Bianca, they saw the boat’s potential as more than a relic: it could become a floating workshop of rebirth.The Lisca Bianca Association was officially founded in 2014 with great help from sponsors and organizations. The restoration of the schooner involved the help from the Palermo juvenile detention center, residents of the Sant’Onofrio recovery community, unaccompanied migrant minors, and individuals recovering from workplace injuries.Over time, Lisca Bianca became the heart of a broader vision: vocational training, social inclusion, sailing programs, sustainable tourism, and initiatives in the green and blue economy. On land, the project found a home in Scalo 5B, a vibrant social space in Palermo. At sea, it continues to welcome those in search of direction and a second chance.Lisca Bianca, born free—continues to sail toward new horizons.Click here for the official website of the Lisca Bianca Association.

Whether painting, running, or quietly thinking, a well-cared-for body is always your strongest partner. Psychologist Snyder's \"Hope Theory\" suggests a healthy body is not only the result of hope but also a source of hope. When we nourish our bodies through food, we build motivation to chase goals and strengthen problem-solving ability.When it comes to health, something as intuitive as eating has become unnecessarily complicated; what nourishes us has now caused problems. How might we eat properly without compromising gastronomical pursuits?Here’s a good news from the leading artist Tung: there’s a way out! In this workshop on food and body awareness, fitness coach/writer Yat will lead us through muscle training. Subsequently, chef/editor Alan will prepare a healthy, light meal. Explore how food helps your body reach its ideal state and responds to creativity and exercise rhythms. Starting with \"eat well,” we'll make food an integral part of our cultural practice as a way to “live well” with hope._______________________費用全免(參加者須預繳港幣100元可退還按金)Free (participants are required to settle a refundable deposit at HKD100 to secure their registration)_______________________導師 Instructors羅維日（阿日）Law Wai Yat (Yat)健齡13年，由35吋肚腩到24/7腹肌，期望諸君食得開心操得順心，不再把白烚無鹽誤會成健康的不二法門。With 13 years of fitness experience, gone from a 35-inch waist to having abs all day. Hope everyone enjoy eating and exercising without thinking plain boiled food is the only healthy option.虞興華 Alan Yu《Sample樣本》雜誌編輯，因貪食而轉行，現職廚師。相信透過理解食物與技術的本質，可以讓簡單的食物也變得美味。最愛的食物是漢堡和牛扒。Editor of Sample magazine turned chef.
