Various studies have shown that children who regularly practice yoga have better health and emotional balance, and are less likely to be afflicted with common health issues such as allergies, asthma, digestive disorders, obesity, ADD and ADHD.At Anahata Yoga, parents who enjoy yoga also pave the way for their children to enjoy the activity, making yoga a regular family activity and cultivating a healthy lifestyle. And just as yoga can be tailored according to the needs and capacities of every individual, so can kids’ yoga be designed to match the interests of every individual child – not only ensuring a healthy body and mind, but also some fun and laughter along the way.About Kids Yoga Teacher Training CourseAnahata Yoga’s Kids’ Yoga Teacher Training Course (100 hours) is one of the first accredited Certification Program for Kid’s yoga in Hong Kong.

These bowls are played by striking or rubbing the rim with a mallet, creating harmonic sounds that promote relaxation and mindfulness. The sound waves produced can help to balance energy, reduce stress, and facilitate a meditative state. This ancient practice is rooted in various spiritual traditions and is gaining popularity in modern wellness for its ability to enhance emotional and physical well-being.- Calming Effect: The soothing tones of singing bowls can create a calming environment that helps reduce anxiety for both dogs and their owners, making it a perfect tool for relaxation.- Bonding Experience: Participating in sound healing sessions together can strengthen the bond between dogs and their owners, promoting feelings of safety and trust.- Stress Relief: Just as humans experience stress, pets can also feel anxious. The gentle sounds can help alleviate stress in dogs, making them more relaxed and at ease.- Enhanced Well-Being: Sound healing can promote physical and emotional well-being for both dogs and their masters, contributing to a healthier lifestyle and better quality of life.- Positive Environment: The vibrations and sounds can create a positive atmosphere that encourages playfulness and joy, benefiting the overall mood of the household.Overall, sound healing fosters a peaceful space that nurtures the connection between humans and their canine companions.在以下鏈接預約位置： https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd6Eac724J0yIOOs2qRryfTorMGgEFB95eMNlVCGWdpC-cMSg/viewform?usp=header票價：HKD$480，包含1人 + 1隻寵物（到達時支付）_______________________________Shoji 將於 7 月 27 日為狗狗及其主人呈現一場頌缽音療約會。頌缽音療是一種治療性實踐，利用頌缽產生的共鳴音調和振動，這些頌缽通常由金屬或水晶製成。頌缽通過用槌子敲擊或摩擦邊緣來演奏，產生和諧的聲音，促進放鬆和正念。所產生的聲波可以幫助平衡能量、減少壓力並促進冥想狀態。這種古老的實踐根植於各種靈性傳統中，並因其增強情感和身體健康的能力而在現代健康領域中越來越受歡迎。鎮靜效果：頌缽的舒緩音調可以創造一個平靜的環境，有助於減少狗狗和主人之間的焦慮，成為放鬆的完美工具。增強聯繫：共同參加音療會可以加強狗狗和主人之間的聯繫，促進安全感和信任感。減壓：和人類一樣，寵物也會感到焦慮。柔和的聲音可以幫助減輕狗狗的壓力，使它們更加放鬆和自在。提升福祉：音療可以促進狗狗和主人的身體和情感健康，有助於更健康的生活方式和更好的生活質量。積極環境：振動和聲音可以創造一種積極的氛圍，鼓勵玩耍和快樂，造福整個家庭的心情。總括而言，音療促進了一個和平的空間，培養人類與其犬類伴侶之間的聯繫。"
