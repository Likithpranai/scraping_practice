    "about": "Join Sky Kung in this hands-on workshop to build an electroacoustic instrument that transforms everyday materials into evolving soundscapes. Participants will experiment with vibrating plates made of metal, wood, springs, and other objects using transducers and motors. The resulting resonances will be captured with contact microphones and shaped through an internal feedback circuit to explore drones, textures, and sonic unpredictability.This workshop is ideal for anyone interested in building electroacoustic instruments. No prior experience in DIY electronics is required, though some familiarity with playing musical instruments is preferred. Participants will get hands-on experience soldering components to a PCB, and experimenting with transducers and contact mics to discover new sounds.Sky Kung is a Hong Kong-based media artist, music producer, and instrument maker. His works across Sound Art, Performance and Device Making. His practice seeks to expand artistic potential, empowering creators to shape their own tools, while bridging technical experimentation with expressive freedom.⁠He is the 2025 Sonic Transmission Artist-in-Residence at CMHK and recently completed a residency at iii (instrument inventor initiative) in The Hague. The instrument created in this workshop is inspired by the ideas and insights he gained during that residency.As a guitarist in the band Lucid Express, he creates dreamlike textures with effect pedals while also designing his own, combining digital signal processing and analog circuitry.Bi- lingual (Cantonese & English)加入 Sky Kung 的這個實踐工作坊，打造一個電聲樂器，將日常材料轉化為不斷變化的聲音景觀。參加者將使用換能器和馬達實驗金屬、木材、彈簧和其他物品製作的振動板。產生的共鳴將通過接觸麥克風捕捉，並經由內部反饋電路塑造，以探索無人機、質感和聲音的不可預測性。這個工作坊非常適合任何對構建電聲樂器感興趣的人。無需具備 DIY 電子學的先前經驗，但對於演奏樂器有一定熟悉度者將更佳。參加者將獲得實際經驗，將元件焊接到 PCB，並實驗換能器和接觸麥克風，以發現新聲音。Sky Kung 是一位駐港的媒體藝術家、音樂製作人和樂器製作人。他的作品涉及聲音藝術、表演和設備製作。他的實踐旨在擴展藝術潛能，賦予創作者塑造自己工具的能力，同時將技術實驗與表達自由相結合。他是2025年 CMHK 的聲音傳遞藝術駐留藝術家，最近在海牙的 iii（樂器發明倡議）完成了一個駐留計劃。本工作坊中創造的樂器靈感來自於他在該駐留期間獲得的想法和見解。作為樂隊 Lucid Express 的吉他手，他使用效果踏板創造夢幻般的質感，同時設計自己的效果器，結合數字信號處理和模擬電路。講座將以雙語（廣東話和英語）進行。"

    "about": "This presentation will introduce Edward Sanderson's research into the spaces for sound art and experimental music as they have developed in the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong, and describe some of my recent activities based on this research.For the last 15 years or so he has focused on spaces for sound art and experimental music and spatially-related practices that find their homes in these spaces. Geographically, he restricts himself to the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong (already a huge area), and the period is from the late 1990s to the present day, although he also deals with some earlier material for context. This research has led him to build up a physical archive of material, currently based in Hong Kong, and from this I have produced various texts, events, and curated exhibitions.This talk will be structured around four important stages in the development of this research: His PhD at HK Baptist University's Academy of Visual Art; the 2023 “Sounds Like Print” display at Tai Kwun Contemporary; the recently concluded exhibition “It Always Sounds Somewhere” at the Inside-Out Art Museum in Beijing; and the performance series “Exit-Entry” which invites Mainland artists to perform alongside local artists, and which serves as a further means to promote connections and knowledge sharing between the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong._______________Bio:Dr. Edward Sanderson is a researcher and curator focusing on contemporary non-mainstream sonic practices from the Chinese Mainland and Hong Kong. In 2025 Edward curated the exhibition \"It Always Sounds Somewhere\" at Inside-Out Art Museum in Beijing, presenting an extensive set of installations of the multiple forms of space used for sound art and experimental music, supplemented by a series of related performances and talks. Edward is currently developing a physical and online archive of sound-related material, and co-curating the Exit-Entry performance series bringing together Chinese Mainland and local artists to play in Hong Kong’s underground venues.Talk to be held in English這場演講將介紹 Edward Sanderson 對中國大陸和香港聲音藝術及實驗音樂空間的研究，並描述他基於這項研究所進行的一些近期活動。在過去的15年左右，他專注於聲音藝術和實驗音樂的空間，以及在這些空間中發展的與空間相關的實踐。他的研究地理範圍限於中國大陸和香港（已經是一個相當龐大的區域），研究時間從1990年代末到現在，同時他也會涉及一些早期的材料以提供背景。這項研究使他建立了一個實體檔案庫，目前位於香港，並由此產生了各種文本、活動和策展展覽。這場演講將圍繞這項研究發展的四個重要階段進行：他在香港浸會大學視覺藝術學院的博士學位；2023年在大館當代藝術中心的“Sounds Like Print”展覽；最近結束的北京 Inside-Out 藝術博物館的展覽“它總是在某處響起”；以及“Exit-Entry”表演系列，邀請大陸藝術家與本地藝術家共同表演，進一步促進中國大陸與香港之間的聯繫和知識分享。_______________簡介：Edward Sanderson 博士是一位研究者和策展人，專注於來自中國大陸和香港的當代非主流聲音實踐。在2025年，Edward 在北京 Inside-Out 藝術博物館策劃了展覽“它總是在某處響起”，展示了多種用於聲音藝術和實驗音樂的空間形式的安裝作品，並輔以一系列相關的表演和講座。Edward 正在開發一個與聲音相關的實體和在線檔案庫，並共同策劃 Exit-Entry 表演系列，將中國大陸藝術家和本地藝術家聚集在香港的地下場地演出。講座將以英語進行。"
