    "about": "OverviewEver since the explosion of TV show \"Who's Line is it Anyway?\", the short-form style of improv (consisting of short scenes combining audience suggestions, improviser talents and pre-selected rules) has become synonymous with improv comedy. Though by no means the only style of improv, it is one that TBC Improv specialises in and this course will teach you the techniques behind it.Each class in the 8-week course will explore a particular genre of game: what games fall into the category, what skills they use and techniques for performing scenes within them. Become familiar with new games and reacquainted with old favourites!This course is ideally aimed at: those with some basic improv training and wishing to expand further; those who wish to specialise in short-form improv; performers with long-form background/experience wishing to become more relaxed and familiar with short-form improv.Class TopicsGeneral improv basics (refresher)Naive GamesCharacter & Scene GamesRestricted GamesMime & Physical GamesMusical & Rhyming GamesAudience Participation GamesThe Games List (or \"How To Choose What To Play\")Pre-requisite:Introduction to Improv (101) (or proof of equivalent)Dates and Times:Thursday evenings, 7:30-10:00pmSep 4, 11, 18, 25Oct 9, 16, 23, 30(Note: No class Oct 2)Our TBC Course Structure Explained:Our courses and classes have 2 defining numbers.

From my Chindian childhood in the 90s, strict Indian family career expectations, engineering life, my Germany adventures, and...my niche toilet preferences.As always, the jokes are clean, culturally relatable, and perfect for locals and international friends alike!

    "about": "BODY COUNT is a visceral and provocative exploration of the human form as both a site of trauma and resilience. Through a fusion of  performance and mixed-media installation the piece interrogates the ways bodies are quantified, commodified, and politicized—whether in war, healthcare, or systemic violence.Drawing from inspiration: forensic anthropology, memorial archives and  personal narratives, the work distorts and reconstructs the body, challenging viewers to confront the tension between individual identity and statistical anonymity. Fragmented, multiplied, or erased, the forms question: When does a body become a number? Who gets counted, and who remains invisible?With specific elements like repetitive silhouettes, raw data sonified and visualized, _Body Count_ oscillates between the intimate and the impersonal, urging a reckoning with the weight of collective loss and the fragility of corporeal existence.________Philipp Henkel is a German composer, curator, and multimedia artist based in Hannover. In his music, gestural instability and extended expressionism transform the subjective listening experience. His compositions and multimedia works explore the implications of technology and societal failure(s) through a research-led approach. In 2018 Henkel founded neuMERZ an interdisciplinary studio for research led art projects and curation in which he remains the artistic lead. Recent concerts and exhibitions of his work have taken place at GAIDA Festival in Lithuania, 21st Century Art Museum Kanazawa, Ryoguku Monten Hall Tokyo, Monopol Berlin, ZKM Karlsruhe."

    "about": "All the times I couldn’t say goodbye… is a deeply personal performance project by Roberto Maqueda that transforms unspoken farewells into sound. It explores the emotional landscape of relationships that faded without closure—those moments suspended in silence and unresolved endings. Through four original compositions, the work navigates cycles of memory, doubt, and longing, while ultimately offering a fragile sense of hope. Premiered in Zürich in 2025, the piece is an attempt to sonify the unsaid and give voice to what was left behind."

    "about": "“Channelling” is a kinetic audiovisual project, in which a collection of motor devices salvaged from obsolete and discarded consumer technology is reanimated by environmental sound recordings. In turn, this produces new sounds from the devices, which are amplifed using various microphones and techniques.The recordings feature seemingly mundane sound phenomena that occur unpredictably and irregularly in everyday life – passing traffic, wind, doors closing – and also sounds of other machines malfunctioning. Because of this, the movement of the devices is random, variable, and autonomous. This means the relationship between performer and devices is a collaboration rather than a master and servant type situation.“Channelling Reduction” follows the trend of technology to miniaturise as it evolves, becoming smaller and lighter, but more powerful.Simon Whetham:Since 2005 Simon Whetham has worked with sonic activity as a material. He often uses environmental sound, employing a variety of methods and techniques in order to obtain often unnoticed and obscured sonic phenomena. He also explores ways of creating physical traces of sound and transforming energy forms.Whetham performs and exhibits internationally, has received a large number of commissions and awards, has many published composed works and regularly collaborates with other artists. His practice also covers giving active listening, field recording and technology repurposing workshops."
