Improve your ability to guide technical discussions, remove blockers, and foster real collaboration between team members.Recognise Red Flags Early.Learn how to spot technical risks, dependencies, and bottlenecks before they derail your Sprint.Boost Your Professional Credibility. Earn greater respect and trust from your developers by showing you truly get their world.What happens when technical conversations go over your head? When decisions are made based on jargon you don’t fully understand? Or when you want to uncover what’s slowing down delivery without always needing a developer to translate? The age-old debate: should a Scrum Master be technical? It’s a hot topic, one that sparks discussions, debates, confusion, curiosity, and even controversy. But the answer is actually quite simple: it doesn’t really matter. There are highly successful technical Scrum Masters, and there are non-technical ones who fail miserably, and vice versa. It depends on many factors. But one thing is certain: having technical knowledge in your Scrum backpack is never a bad thing.This one-day workshop won’t turn you into a full-fledged Developer, that would be absurd to promise. What it will do is give you a solid foundation in IT and software engineering without writing a single line of code.Facilitated by seasoned technical trainers who’ve worked in the trenches, supported by the collective knowledge of the group, and yes, let’s be real, some help from AI, we’ll explore key technical concepts and dive into modern development workflows. Whether you’re dealing with legacy systems, cloud-native platforms, or anything in between, this day will equip you to ask better questions, spot risks earlier, engage more confidently in technical discussions, and foster stronger collaboration with your Developers, technical stakeholders, and teams while staying true to the Scrum Master accountabilities."
