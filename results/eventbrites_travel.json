The British colonial period started in 1841 (only 182 years ago). What did Hong Kong look like in the pre-colonial period?In this tour, I will take you to the ancestral hall of the traditional Chinese House. I will also show you the tradition of worshipping god in a temple.1. Traditional Walled Village - Tsang Tai UkOne of Hong Kong’s best-preserved walled villages. You can still see the original granite, bricks and timber used to build the village. Guard towers were built on each of the four corners to protect against pirates, who ran rampant in Hong Kong until the early 20th century. This is still a living village.2. Sha Tin Che Kung TempleThis is a temple of 300 years old. Was built before the colonial period. You will learn about the traditional culture3. The Old House at Wong Uk Village Wong Uk Village was founded during the reign of Qianlong (1736-1795) in the Qing dynasty by the Wong clan from Xingning county in Guangdong. In the 19th century, the village became a major trading station for travellers and traders plying the route between Guangdong and Kowloon and prospered until the late 19th century. I will show you how to appreciate the fine mural paintings and traditional decorations on the traditional house.4.High Rock CentreIt was old police barracks of Shatin and also the place for orphans. The main building was a large, two-storey brick and wood building.5 ,6,7..... and more places in the tours.
