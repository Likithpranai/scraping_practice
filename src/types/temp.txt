IMPORTANT RULES:
    1. For "hidden_gem_score": Use a scale from 0-100 where 0=extremely popular tourist spot, 100=only locals know about it

    6. Focus on places that are CURRENTLY OPERATING (not closed or historical)
    9. For "recognition": Use specific source names (e.g., "Michelin Guide", "TimeOut", "OpenRice") and keep descriptions brief. Use "Others" for general recognitions without specific sources
    10. For "tags_type": Ensure the percentages add up to 100 and accurately reflect the spot's primary characteristics
    11. For "tags_budget": Only ONE budget category should be set to 1, all others should be 0
    12. For "tags_group": Distribute percentages to reflect which groups the spot is most suitable for (total should be 100)
